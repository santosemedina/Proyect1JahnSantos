**To end the game early, just click on the X of the window.**

1) With RIGHT CLICK, you can mark the squares where you think there is a mine.
2) You have to LEFT CLICK ALL the squares that are not mines in order to win.
3) If you click a square where there is a mine, you lose.
4) The numbers that appear are the number of mines that are around that square.
5) Before the game begins, you will be notified how many bombs were placed in the grid.
6) A bomb number will appear on the bottom right of the screen for reference.
